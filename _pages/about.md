I'm Mario Rico Ibáñez, a **Telecommunications Engineer** pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/) with a Bachelor's degree in **Telecommunications Engineering** from UPV. I'm also enrolled in a **long-term Mathematics program** at UNED. My research focuses on applying cutting-edge **Deep Reinforcement Learning** techniques to optimize UAV-based communication networks and telecommunications infrastructure.

Currently completing my Master's at EPFL, I specialize in the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **telecommunications**, with particular expertise in **UAV networks**, **mobile communications**, and **AI security research**. My work spans from **Deep Reinforcement Learning** for base station optimization to **adversarial attacks on diffusion models**, with research submitted to **ICML 2025**.

## Research Focus

My research interests center on advancing telecommunications and AI security:
- **UAV Networks & Mobile Communications**: Optimizing aerial base station positioning using Deep Reinforcement Learning
- **AI Security & Adversarial Attacks**: Query-free attacks on image-to-image generative models (ICML 2025 submission)
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Applications in telecommunications infrastructure and emergency networks
- **Diffusion Models & Computer Vision**: Investigating vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art generative AI systems
- **Multi-modal AI Systems**: Combining different data modalities for comprehensive analysis

## Academic Journey

With specialized **telecommunications engineering** training from UPV and ongoing **mathematical studies** at UNED, I've built expertise across multiple domains. My Bachelor's thesis on "Deep Reinforcement Learning for UAV Base Station Dynamic Positioning" launched my research career at the intersection of AI and telecommunications.

My current Master's at EPFL extends this work, where I'm exploring advanced machine learning techniques, mobile networks, and distributed algorithms to solve complex real-world problems in telecommunications.

## Beyond Research

When I'm not working on research or coding, I stay active through **gym training**, **running**, **tennis**, and **boxing**. I'm passionate about **mountain hiking** - there's something about the challenge and the views that complements my love for solving complex algorithmic problems.

I have a particular fascination with **Rubik's cubes** and other puzzles, which feeds into my approach to **problem-solving** and **algorithmic thinking**. I'm also deeply committed to **teaching and mentoring**, sharing knowledge with fellow students and contributing to the academic community.
