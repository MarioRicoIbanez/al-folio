Mario Rico Ibáñez is a master's student in Computer Science at EPFL and a machine learning developer with experience in emotion recognition and wireless communications. He received his BSc in Telecommunications Engineering from the Universitat Politècnica de València, where he ranked among the top students. His current interests span deep learning, reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence for mobile networks. Previously he worked at the Computer Vision & Behaviour Analysis Lab researching transformer-based models for multilabel emotion recognition, and at the Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia developing GPU-based wireless simulators and DRL algorithms. Outside of research, he enjoys sports and teaching.
